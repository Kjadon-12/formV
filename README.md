In this project -
#for storing all country/state/city--i've used code/file data.jsx of this repo(only once)
1.first i've stored all Countries and State into db (mongodb) with the help of country-state-city package , but i have not stored all cities(because it was taking too much time cities were 1lakh+ , so i stopped code in between)


#created few API(s) for getting country/and states of selected country and cities of selected country and state 

and finally storing the data into users collection
